          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>
            Gaming has always been one of my biggest passions. I enjoy both
            competitive and story-driven games, often diving deep into immersive
            worlds and complex strategies. It's more than just entertainment —
            it's how I unwind and sometimes get inspired.

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
            I listen to music throughout the day — from chill beats while
            working to synth-heavy tracks that energize me. Genres like
            synthwave, lo-fi, and ambient keep me grounded and focused. It's the
            rhythm behind my daily flow.

          <h3>Riding</h3>
          <p>
            There's something freeing about riding my motorcycle through open
            roads and unfamiliar places. It clears my mind, helps me reflect,
            and gives me a sense of calm. Whether it's a short city ride or a
            weekend escape, it's always worth it.

          <h3>Exploring</h3>
          <p>
            I love discovering new places — from hidden coffee shops to distant
            provinces I've never seen before. Exploring helps me reset and
            sparks creativity by changing my perspective. It's an adventure I
            seek whenever I have time to spare.
