    I've worked on several projects, mostly focusing on backend development.<br><br>
    I'm still learning a lot along the way, especially in using AWS tools like EC2, DynamoDB, S3, and API Gateway.<br>
    I try to understand how to make systems more efficient and reliable.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    On the frontend, I usually handle basic authentication — often with NextAuth in Next.js projects.<br><br>
    I use frameworks like Next.js and Vite, and I prefer using TypeScript whenever I can.<br>
    I'm also trying to improve my skills in making responsive websites.<br><br>
    Right now, I'm exploring Expo and React Native, especially for building apps for smart TVs.

        <h3>AWS Backend Practice</h3>
        <p>
          I'm learning how to use API Gateway together with AWS Lambda to handle serverless backend logic. The Lambda functions query data from DynamoDB and upload files to S3 using pre-signed URLs. Most of the backend work I've done is through trial and error, improving with each project.

        <h3>Databases: PostgreSQL & MongoDB</h3>
        <p>
          I've used both relational and NoSQL databases for my apps. While I'm still improving my understanding of schemas and queries, I've gained experience connecting them to backend services.

        <h3>Frontend Auth with Next.js</h3>
        <p>
          Most of my frontend work involves adding login features using NextAuth. I'm still learning how to improve UI design, but I try to make the auth experience smooth and secure.

        <h3>React Native with Expo</h3>
        <p>
          I recently started exploring mobile and smart TV development using Expo. It's something new for me, and I'm trying to understand layout handling and cross-platform design better.
