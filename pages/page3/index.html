          <h3>Elix Esports - iAcademy</h3>
          <p>
            I was a member of the early Elix Esports squad at iAcademy, during
            its unofficial beginnings. We trained and scrimmed regularly, united
            by a shared passion for competitive gaming. It was an exciting time
            to be part of a growing community of student players.

          <h3>AcadArena - Valorant Competitor</h3>
          <p>
            I represented my school in competitive Valorant tournaments hosted
            by AcadArena. Playing against some of the best student teams in the
            country helped sharpen my communication and team synergy under
            pressure. These events were intense, rewarding, and truly
            unforgettable.
